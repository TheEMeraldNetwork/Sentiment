The social media platform pleads its case before the January 19 deadline for the divest-or-ban to take effect. CNET technology reporter Abrar Al-Heeti joins Brad Smith on Wealth to discuss what users should expect as a TikTok ban looms. ""Come January 19th, if TikTok gets banned, it's not going to magically disappear from your device,"" Al-Heeti explains. ""Instead, you won't be getting updates, which means that over time, it becomes more laggy and then eventually unusable."" She notes that Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google will be fined if TikTok and updates are available on their app stores. Al-Heeti suggests saving videos on your that you want to keep, whether you posted them or another user, from the platform. She adds that Meta's (META) Instagram Reels have been a ""strong TikTok competitor"" and could be an alternate platform for users to shift to, while Snapchat (SNAP) could be another option.

She notes the popular social media app's 200% year-over-year growth in traffic. ""It captures your attention with the content and the algorithm, and through personalization, it drives you through the funnel to get you to convert,"" Tipograph says. ""So it's the power of the entire marketing funnel that exists within TikTok. You find some of that in Meta, you find some of that in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) but TikTok is the whole story."" Tipograph notes if the Chinese-owned app is banned, Alphabet could see the biggest gains in ad revenue, while e-commerce platforms like Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and Walmart (WMT) could benefit from TikTok Shops' potential loss.

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc.,2025-01-02 18:13:31,Can the Magnificent 7 keep dominating in 2025?,"In 2024, tech stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" led in market gains. However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.,2025-01-02 18:13:31,Can the Magnificent 7 keep dominating in 2025?,"In 2024, tech stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" led in market gains. However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

""I think it's nothing sort of too far out of the ordinary,"" Ferguson says, noting that some drone activity, both recreational and ""a bit of surveillance,"" is typical. As drones make headlines, investors may wonder whether the tech could benefit aerospace and defense companies.

""I wouldn't say [the current AI-related market] is necessarily a bubble, but I think you really have to be careful about just throwing money at the same old places that you did last year because technology needs different things as it rolls out, and this is going to be a longer rollout than anybody who's currently investing and has won so far, is really prepared for,"" Forrest says. She tells investors, ""Pace yourself and understand that the technology is going to mutate a little. Right now, Nvidia (NVDA) is the big winner, and they have a GPU chip, but it seems like Broadcom (AVGO) has a solution for another part of the problem, which is inference. So maybe you want to look for companies like Marvell (MRVL) and Broadcom that are doing that are adding to the solution."" Forrest notes, ""I wouldn't kick Nvidia to the curb. You know they are still doing very well, and their product is needed. It's just that you may lose momentum.""

""Come January 19th, if TikTok gets banned, it's not going to magically disappear from your device,"" Al-Heeti explains. ""Instead, you won't be getting updates, which means that over time, it becomes more laggy and then eventually unusable.""

Al-Heeti suggests saving videos on your that you want to keep, whether you posted them or another user, from the platform. She adds that Meta's (META) Instagram Reels have been a ""strong TikTok competitor"" and could be an alternate platform for users to shift to, while Snapchat (SNAP) could be another option.

She notes the popular social media app's 200% year-over-year growth in traffic. ""It captures your attention with the content and the algorithm, and through personalization, it drives you through the funnel to get you to convert,"" Tipograph says. ""So it's the power of the entire marketing funnel that exists within TikTok. You find some of that in Meta, you find some of that in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) but TikTok is the whole story."" Tipograph notes if the Chinese-owned app is banned, Alphabet could see the biggest gains in ad revenue, while e-commerce platforms like Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and Walmart (WMT) could benefit from TikTok Shops' potential loss.

META,Meta Platforms Inc.,2025-01-02 18:13:31,Can the Magnificent 7 keep dominating in 2025?,"In 2024, tech stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" led in market gains. However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

Rhind notes, ""The memory part of the AI market that they're in, the company itself expects to grow pretty dramatically in the next few years."" He also points out that the memory chip market is ""overlooked,"" predicting a shift in Micron's favor in 2025. Conversely, Rhind suggests avoiding Intel (INTC), describing the company's declining market share as ""a slow-rolling tragedy."" He notes that Pat Gelsinger's recent departure as CEO raises ""a lot of questions"" about Intel's direction, emphasizing the company's challenges in trying to ""prioritize for the long-term future.""

Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon joins Market Domination to discuss the growing divide. Goujon highlights recent policy initiatives like the Routers Act and the US Commerce Department's ICTS (Information and Communications Technology and Services) controls, which aim to remove Chinese components from infrastructure due to increased data and cybersecurity concerns. She notes that companies like TP-Link have become deeply embedded in US infrastructure, making this a complex challenge. ""What the US is doing is it's saying that 'look, there's a number of toolmakers out there that still want to feed into the Chinese chip market,'"" Goujon explains. She describes a new ""single chip de minimis"" provision that would extend US restrictions to any factory worldwide using even one US chip. ""So the US is basically telling partners 'do the right thing, align with us or else you're going to be subject to US law and compliance.'"" However, Goujon cautions that the immediate impact may be limited: ""The issue is that China has been able to stockpile an enormous amount of equipment, especially over the past one and a half years... and so it may take a while to even see the effects of export controls biting.""

However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

Kinahan tells the Morning Brief team that Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT), and Reddit (RDDT) are the top bullish picks. ""[Cisco] is one that I think is really interesting,"" Kinahan says, adding, ""We hear so much about AI ... and what I think people sometimes forget is you really need the networkers also"" and, ""I think the networking side of it is the most underrated side of what's going on in AI."" He notes, ""Cisco is really well positioned [and] we've seen our clients and our Tastytrade brokerage side really start to over the last three weeks, particularly, buy this stock."" The second name that clients have been ""buying significantly"" is Microsoft, which Kinahan says is ""not a big surprise"" given ""the fact that it's a darling of retail [investors, it's] usually one of the top three names."" ""The last one on there [is] Reddit and what we've seen there is not only our clients loving it. I think there was [some] doubt [for] some people if it could compete in the social media context, [but] they've done an incredible job overall of continuing to add users"" and have gained bullish calls from analysts. On the other hand, Kinahan says three stocks that have seen bearish trading activity heading into 2025 are Dell Technologies (DELL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and Pfizer (PFE).

Aurora stock jumped by over 30% in Tuesday's session after announcing these collaborations, with shares now settling and closing the trading week just slightly higher. Aurora CEO Chris Urmson explains ""Nvidia provides a really critical part of our system"" — the Aurora Driver system that enables the autonomous vehicles — ""the processor that our algorithms run on."" Nvidia's Drive Thor and DriveOS (operating system) will be integrated into the Aurora Driver system. ""If you're a trucking company today, you're limited to driving that vehicle 11 hours a day because people get tired. With what we're building with the Aurora driver, you should be able to operate that vehicle more like 20 hours a day,"" Urmson further elaborates, adding that this will reduce the dangers of stress and sleep deprivation for long-haul commercial truckers. ""The driver won't get tired. So you can run longer at lower speeds, so you have more fuel economy, which is good for the environment and good for the bottom line. And, of course, while driving a truck is a really important job and we should be thankful for anyone who's willing to do it, there aren't enough people who actually want to do it because it's a tough job."" Urmson also discusses with Market Domination's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton the pre-revenue company's competition with other self-driving truck innovators — such as Tesla (TSLA) — and its current customers, such as FedEx (FDX) and Uber Freight (UBER).

D.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria breaks down the chipmaker's stock moves during the trading day and explains why he considers himself the ""least bullish"" Wall Street analyst covering Nvidia. ""I like to think of myself as maybe the least bullish of the 60-something analysts that cover Nvidia,"" Luria says. ""The reason is that I think this is a cycle just like any other cycle we've ever seen, which is to say: This may be the peak year of the cycle."" The analyst continues, ""For Nvidia stock to be attractive from here, you would need to believe that it can grow 15, 20% into next year and the year after that. We think that that may not happen."" Luria notes that hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are unlikely to continue spending at their current monumental rate and that sovereign artificial intelligence customers are unlikely to make up for any normalization of Big Tech capital spending.

But investors may not want to get too excited about them just yet. D.A. Davidson senior software analyst Gil Luria thinks that these agents are not ""going to be enough of a success to drive revenue for a company that may approach $40 billion of revenue next year."" Luria notes that the pricing models for AI agents are still a work in progress and that Salesforce (CRM) is trying a different method. ""What Salesforce is suggesting now is a per-transaction model. That actually scares customers because they don't want success to become a problem. If their users use this tool too much, then they're gonna have an unpredictable bill."" Luria suggests that customers will need to adjust to being charged per transaction and, as a result, it will ""probably only drive very moderate revenue next year,"" he says.

The reason is none other than optimism around new AI powered digital agents. Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff took the wraps off its Agentforce 2.0 platform at an event in San Francisco. The new technology offers a new library of pre-built skills and workflow integrations. Benioff told me Salesforce has signed 1,000 more revenue based Agentforce deals since it reported earnings a few weeks ago. That call out may go a long way in tempering ongoing skepticism on the financial impact of digital agents. “We still maintain some skepticism around the durability/monetization of Salesforce’s Agentforce products amid limited in production data points and the rapidly evolving competitive landscape,” Citi analyst Tyler Radke said.

SMCI,Super Micro Computer Inc.,2025-01-03 18:00:00,MicroStrategy history: Beyond the Ticker,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its chairman, Michael Saylor, are practically synonymous with bitcoin (BTC-USD) these days, but the business intelligence company has been around since 1989. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into the company’s biggest moments. 1989 Back then, it was all about data analytics, and Saylor – fresh out of MIT – was a rising tech star. 1998 With the dot-com boom well underway, MicroStrategy went public under the familiar MSTR ticker at $12 per share. It rocketed to $333 as the dot-com boom peaked. Saylor became a paper billionaire practically overnight and wasn’t afraid to spend his wealth on legendary parties and a yacht, capturing the flashy spirit of the era. 2000 But when the dot-com bubble burst, MicroStrategy’s stock plummeted to just 42 cents, a stunning 99.9% drop. The company had to restate its financials, and the SEC slapped the company with fines. Still, Saylor held on, shifting MicroStrategy’s focus back to enterprise software and slowly dug the company out of its hole. 2010 MicroStrategy was moving into mobile analytics, and Saylor wrote a prescient book about the coming smartphone revolution called, “The Mobile Wave.” 2014 Facing stiff competition, MicroStrategy laid off more than 700 workers, and Saylor cut his own salary to just one dollar. 2020 The pandemic, however, would bring new opportunities. Saylor pivoted MicroStrategy again – this time into bitcoin – arguing that it was a better store of value than cash. 2024 He poured billions of corporate dollars into it. And today, MicroStrategy holds around 439,000 bitcoin with an average purchase price just over $60,000. With bitcoin trading around $100,000 per coin, MicroStrategy’s crypto stash is worth $44 billion. Investors, however, are placing a significant premium on the company, pushing its market capitalization to $89 billion – enough to secure its admission to the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) on December 23, replacing Super Micro Computer (SMCI.NE).

SMCI,Super Micro Computer Inc.,2024-12-16 18:30:00,Trump & chip sector: Investors need 'supply chain resilience plan',"President-elect Donald Trump has made tariffs a key focus of his second term in the White House, proposing a 60% tariff on all goods from China. The impact of Trump's second term on the semiconductor sector, which has become especially important during the artificial intelligence (AI) era, has been debated, given the impact of tariffs and uncertainty around the CHIPS and Science Act. Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Tufts University professor of International History Christopher Miller join Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss their outlook for the chip sector under Trump 2.0. Moorhead expects Trump to be a ""net positive"" for the chip sector: ""Trump doesn't want to be the president that tanked the tech stock market, and he certainly could do that if he puts any weight on the chip stocks that have been a tremendous part of the growth over the last four years."" ""With all of the advanced semiconductor manufacturing leaving the United States, or most of it, Trump's trying to get the best deal to bring it back in. I do not believe he will tank the stock market or major industries to make that happen,"" Moorhead notes. Miller — the author of Chip War: The Fight for World's Most Critical Technology — says Trump's chip policy is ""being defined right now by the president-elect and his incoming administration,"" adding that tariffs will likely be a key component of his approach to the semiconductor sector, though there will likely be negotiations between his proposals and the actual policies. Amid uncertainty about Trump's actual policies and their impacts on chipmakers, Moorhead cautions investors saying they ""should be looking into every one of their investment plays and seeing if they have a supply chain resilience plan. It's a what if [plan]."" Watch the video above to learn more about the US-China trade war, the impact of major chipmakers, and more.

Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC, joins Catalysts to discuss this development. O'Donnell characterizes Nvidia's entry into robotics as ""a long-term play,"" noting that ""it won't happen overnight."" He references Nvidia's early involvement in autonomous vehicles, stating, ""frankly they were a little too early,"" but suggests their head start with such technology means ""now they're coming in much more strongly."" Highlighting Nvidia's ""Cosmos"" release, an artificial intelligence (AI) software platform that ""allows you to do gen AI for physical actions."" In other words, users can train robots, autonomous vehicles, and other devices ""to react and do analog things in the physical world."" He emphasizes its significance, adding, ""That's been a huge stopping point for robotics, and that's why it's a big deal and will have a payoff."" Drawing a parallel to other tech giants, O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance, ""We think about Microsoft (MSFT) on the Windows side, and we think about Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) on the mobile phone side, and maybe Nvidia becomes sort of the platform for robotics.""

While acknowledging their ""tremendous"" returns, he cautions, ""That's a risk because the market is broadening out right now."" He explains, ""We don't want to pay as much of a multiple for companies that are growing slower, which is the Mag Seven, compared to the broader market, which is the Russell 2000 (^RUT) and the Russell mid-cap stocks."" VanCronkhite advises investors to be strategic. ""That doesn't mean sell it; it doesn't mean leave. Just be careful about staying too long. Rotate down,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. Regarding sector opportunities, VanCronkhite expresses caution about the banking sector, describing it as ""nerve-racking"" despite market optimism.

TSLA,Tesla Inc.,2025-01-06 22:02:53,Tesla's stock valuation appears 'discounted': Analyst explains,"President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariff policy has raised investor concerns about its potential impact on industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), particularly for companies like Tesla (TSLA). Stifel NextGen transport analyst Stephen Gengaro joins Market Domination to share his perspective on the EV maker amid tariff uncertainties. Gengaro suggests that Trump's proposed tariff policy would have ""wide-ranging"" effects, including reduced competition in US markets — a development that could be ""theoretically a positive"" for Tesla. However, he cautions that the company may face challenges with its international supply chain for parts sourced outside the US. The analyst emphasizes that Tesla is ""more than a car company,"" pointing to initiatives like full self-driving (FSD) technology as ""a huge value driver"" for the stock in the ""medium-to-long term."" He suggests that the potential of these ventures makes the current stock valuation appear ""discounted."" Looking ahead to the Trump administration, Gengaro anticipates more favorable regulations that could accelerate Tesla's initiatives. ""As far as Musk betting on Trump, I think he's clearly engaged in the conversation as far as getting regulation accelerated on the FSD side,"" he explains. ""And that sort of opens the door for just various growth opportunities for the company over time.""

TWLO,Twilio Inc.,2024-12-27 18:00:00,Mag 7 is turning to 'lag 7': How to play tech in 2025,"Piper Sandler managing director and chief market technician Craig Johnson joins Josh Lipton on Market Domination. He suggests that, although stocks like Apple are trending upward, the ""Magnificent Seven"" — which comprises Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) — may become the ""lag seven"" in 2025 as ""the relative performance has not been nearly as strong."" Johnson shares his strategy for navigating the shifting tech landscape in the coming year. ""I would rather see investors — and I suspect this will happen as you get into early 2025 — taking some, not all, but some of their profits out of those larger cap stocks, reducing those positions, and then again, recognizing some of those gains that they may not have wanted to recognize in 2024 and [shifting] down cap, looking at stocks like Twilio (TWLO)."" He also highlights Robinhood (HOOD) as an opportunity for investors, given the ""more friendly crypto policy from the new administration."" Johnson advises viewers not to forget optical companies, like Coherent (COHR), which ""could be a better place to put some money to work.""
